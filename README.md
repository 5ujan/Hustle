#  HUSTLE
One day gigs, recruit and get recruited

Ever wanted to hire someone to do a mundane task for you because you couldn't get a leave from your full time job?
Ever wanted to make a few bucks on the side while not-doing-so-much?
Want to give back to the community by volunteering? Or you are an organization looking for those who do?

One App to cater them all.
Coming soon in all your favorite Software Stores.

`cd Hustle && npm install && npx expo start`
in another terminal `cd server && npm install && npm run dev`
